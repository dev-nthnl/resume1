	        <h2>About ME<h2>
	        <p>I am a young business professional with interests in the areas of  Data Management and Analysis.<p>
	        <p>I am a self-starter and took the initiative on several occasions recreating office procedures and shortening process time, particularly in our imaging area. I am adept in spreadsheet manipulation and other Microsoft Suite applications. I have also took on small office technology tasks, such as configuring  connections to printers, mapping to shared network drives and troubleshooting problems in Axiom, Extender, and Document Manger. Whenever a technology issue arises I am generally consulted first by peers before submitting tickets to the help desk. In addition I have extreme dedication to training and updating training documentation for better business practices. I am dedicated to continuous improvement and learning by having a full understanding of the current process and procedures and constantly making recommendation to increase efficiency and effectiveness as well as utilizing the knowledge banks that the college offers: Lynda, Skills Soft, Ellucian Knowledge Library Etc</p>
